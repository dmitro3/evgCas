        question: `Why is ${getDomainName()}'s VIP program the best one?`,
        answer: `${getDomainName()}'s VIP program stands out from competitors by offering progressive rewards that increase with your loyalty. Unlike other platforms, we provide exclusive bonuses, personalized support, higher withdrawal limits, and special event invitations that truly reward your dedication. Our VIP members also enjoy custom-tailored promotions and cashback offers that grow with your VIP level.`,
    },
    {
        question: "What is XP?",
        answer: `XP (Experience Points) is ${getDomainName()}'s loyalty currency that you earn through gameplay. Every bet you place contributes to your XP total, allowing you to progress through VIP levels naturally as you enjoy our games. XP accumulates automatically in your account and determines your position in our VIP hierarchy, unlocking increasingly valuable rewards as you advance.`,
    },
    {
        question: "What are the levels of VIP status and their benefits?",
        answer: `${getDomainName()} offers multiple VIP tiers, each with enhanced benefits: Bronze (entry level) provides basic cashback and weekly bonuses; Silver adds higher withdrawal limits and priority support; Gold includes personalized offers and exclusive tournament access; Platinum features dedicated account managers and VIP-only events; while Diamond (our highest tier) offers custom rewards packages, instant withdrawals, and invitation-only experiences. Each level progressively improves your rewards and platform privileges.`,
    },
    {
        question: "I need to make a deposit in the equivalent of XP points for each status?",
        answer: `No, you don't need to make deposits equivalent to XP points. XP is earned naturally through your gameplay on ${getDomainName()}. Every wager you place contributes to your XP total regardless of whether you win or lose. Your VIP status advances automatically as you accumulate XP through regular play, with no minimum deposit requirements tied directly to VIP progression.`,
    },
    {
        question: "How does VIP status affect my chances of winning?",
        answer: `Your VIP status has absolutely no impact on your chances of winning at ${getDomainName()}. All games operate with the same fair and transparent odds regardless of your VIP level. What VIP status does provide are enhanced rewards, bonuses, and services that improve your overall experience and value, but the fundamental game mechanics and winning probabilities remain identical for all players across all VIP tiers.`,
