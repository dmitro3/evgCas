        question: `Why is ${getDomainName()}'s VIP program the best one?`,
        answer: `${getDomainName()}'s VIP program stands out from competitors by offering progressive rewards that increase with your loyalty. Unlike other platforms, we provide exclusive bonuses, personalized support, higher withdrawal limits, and special event invitations that truly reward your dedication. Our VIP members also enjoy custom-tailored promotions and cashback offers that grow with your VIP level.`,
    },
    {
        question: "What is XP?",
        answer: `XP (Experience Points) is ${getDomainName()}'s loyalty currency that you earn through gameplay. Every bet you place contributes to your XP total, allowing you to progress through VIP levels naturally as you enjoy our games. XP accumulates automatically in your account and determines your position in our VIP hierarchy, unlocking increasingly valuable rewards as you advance.`,
    },
    {
        question: "What are the levels of VIP status and their benefits?",
        answer: `${getDomainName()} offers multiple VIP tiers, each with enhanced benefits: Bronze (entry level) provides basic cashback and weekly bonuses; Silver adds higher withdrawal limits and priority support; Gold includes personalized offers and exclusive tournament access; Platinum features dedicated account managers and VIP-only events; while Diamond (our highest tier) offers custom rewards packages, instant withdrawals, and invitation-only experiences. Each level progressively improves your rewards and platform privileges.`,
    },
    {
        question: "I need to make a deposit in the equivalent of XP points for each status?",
        answer: `No, you don't need to make deposits equivalent to XP points. XP is earned naturally through your gameplay on ${getDomainName()}. Every wager you place contributes to your XP total regardless of whether you win or lose. Your VIP status advances automatically as you accumulate XP through regular play, with no minimum deposit requirements tied directly to VIP progression.`,
    },
    {
        question: "How does VIP status affect my chances of winning?",
        answer: `Your VIP status has absolutely no impact on your chances of winning at ${getDomainName()}. All games operate with the same fair and transparent odds regardless of your VIP level. What VIP status does provide are enhanced rewards, bonuses, and services that improve your overall experience and value, but the fundamental game mechanics and winning probabilities remain identical for all players across all VIP tiers.`,

                            Domain, the leader in decentralized Web3 identity, and Huobi, one of the world's largest and most respected crypto exchanges, announce a strategic partnership to significantly expand access to Web3 technologies, simplify payments and significantly improve the user experience of digital assets. This collaboration marks a powerful alliance that combines the strengths of both companies to create a robust, intuitive and immersive environment that will attract more users to the dynamic decentralized world. The partnership also aims to attract new audiences to the fast-growing fields of cryptocasinos and Web3 by offering secure and convenient ways to participate in these innovative ecosystems.

                            The partnership is based on the integration of Domain's advanced solutions into Huobi's infrastructure. This will allow millions of Huobi users to easily create and manage their Web3 identities, opening the door to a world of decentralized applications, games and other innovative services. A particularly important aspect is the simplification of the online payment process. By integrating Web3 identifiers, users will be able to make fast, secure and anonymous transactions in online casinos and other Web3 platforms. This will not only enhance the user experience, but also provide new opportunities for users who wish to explore the exciting world of blockchain-based entertainment. Huobi and Domain believe that this transaction simplification will create an incentive for greater use of Web3 technologies and, as a result, deeper involvement in decentralized projects. It will also open doors to a wider audience that previously refrained from using cryptocurrencies due to the complexities of the payment process
